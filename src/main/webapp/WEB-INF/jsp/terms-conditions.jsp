            <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Welcome to the ebooktrip.com
                ("ebooktrip.com," "we," "our," "us") website (collectively, the "site"). Website use is governed by the
                following terms and conditions. You agree to and accept these terms and conditions by using the website.
                You are not permitted to use it if you disagree with any portion of these terms and conditions. We
                retain the right to change these terms and conditions at any moment. All modified clauses take effect
                immediately after these terms and conditions are revised. After posting, you will be presumed to agree
                to the new terms and conditions if you use the website. Please periodically check this webpage to see if
                there have been any updates.</p>

            <h2 class="subheadings"><strong>100% SAFE SHOPPING GUARANTEE</strong></h2>

            <p>The servers of ebooktrip.com use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to ensure ebooktrip.com
                can read a buyer's data. Mozilla, Safari, Netscape, AOL, and Microsoft Internet. Explorers are all
                browsers that support SSL. We guarantee that any transaction you make on the ebooktrip.com website will
                be completely secure.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Even though we never intend for a credit card fraud incident to occur due to doing business with
                    ebooktrip.com, if unauthorized charges are ever made to your credit card. As a result, you won't be
                    held liable for paying anything.</li>
                <li>Online shopping at ebooktrip.com is statistically safer than using your credit card at a restaurant
                    or department store. Technical experts point out that online purchases without human interaction are
                    far safer than typical credit card transactions since the information is immediately encrypted into
                    a scrambled message that can only be decrypted by an approved machine. </li>
                <li>You'll join the millions of internet buyers who have done so without taking risks. We're sure you'll
                    appreciate the convenience and security of shopping at home once you successfully purchase from
                    ebooktrip.com. </li>
            </ul>


            <p>The Fair Credit Billing Act prohibits your credit card provider from requesting that you pay more than
                $50 in unauthorized charges. If your credit card company does ask you to pay any portion of the $50 it
                can demand, ebooktrip.com will pay the amount, up to the full $50, if the fraudulent use of your credit
                card was caused by transactions you made on the ebooktrip.com website while using the secure server
                without any of your faults.
            </p>

            <p>If such happens, you must let your credit card company know. Disclaimer: ebooktrip.com disclaims any
                liability for the activities of any third parties, including but not limited to airlines, hotels, cruise
                lines, railroads, car rental agencies, tour guides, etc., which offer travel services, and consolidators
                to perform the services provided by such suppliers. </p>

            <p>When it provides travel management services, ebooktrip.com does not guarantee or assure the benefits that
                any suppliers will provide their financial condition or your reimbursement for any losses suffered due
                to those suppliers' financial state. Suppose a supplier defaults before rendering the service for which
                payment has been received. In that case, your only options for obtaining a refund shall be with the
                defaulting supplier, from insurance covering such defaults, if applicable, or from another accountable
                third party, unless such bankruptcy was brought on by ebooktrip.com. You may use any legal or
                legislative remedies available to you to get a refund from a supplier who falters before providing
                services in such circumstances. </p>

            <p>ebooktrip.com guarantees its services will be of the highest caliber available in the sector and
                carefully selects suppliers to protect you from supplier default. Except as expressly stated herein,
                ebooktrip.com disclaims any responsibility for decisions taken regarding travel by third parties over
                whom it has no influence.</p>


            <p>ebooktrip.com disclaims all responsibility and liability for any action, error, omission, harm, loss,
                accident, damage, delay, non-performance, irregularity, or any other consequence thereof brought on by
                the negligence, default, or other act or inaction of any supplier of travel products. After payment has
                been made, ebooktrip.com is not liable for any pricing changes, schedule adjustments, equipment
                modifications, or lodging modifications for any travel service. As a service provider, ebooktrip.com
                provides value-added services to customers and retail travel agents. </p>


            <p>ebooktrip.com doesn't have any influence over the providers it buys travel-related products from, and it
                doesn't take responsibility for their deeds either. If tickets have already been issued, a fee can be
                associated with refunds. While some tickets may be printed with BT (Bulk fare), others may have a
                specific value that may be different (lower or higher) than the fare collected. We have no control over
                the written prices of the tickets. Discounts change depending on several elements, such as the
                airline(s) used, the class of service, the location, the season (low, mid, or high), the amount of prior
                notice given, the minimum stay requirements met, and aircraft load. Other advertiser-sponsored goods and
                services on ebooktrip.com are not warranted, endorsed, verified, or promoted by ebooktrip.com.</p>

            <h3 class="subheadings">Compassion Exception Policy (CEP)</h3>
            <p>The following customers may be exempt from paying the cancellation, refund, or ticket change service fees
                under the terms of this policy: Active duty U.S. military personnel, seniors, bereaved customers,
                bereaved customers between the ages of 16 and 25, people with disabilities, and those who are terminally

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Booking Process</strong></p>

            <p>For your convenience, the meaning of the following terminology used in these terms &amp; Conditions is: "Service Element" refers to a single good or service offered on the website that can be ordered apart from other services. "Travel Supplier" is a company that sells one or more Service Elements. (Examples include hotels, automakers, and airlines). Although ebooktrip.com does not function as the principal, it does establish arrangements with third-party vendors to provide the service elements described above. "Booking" refers to the negotiating process you engage in with the travel supplier when using this site to obtain one or more service elements. If we accept your offer and receive full payment, this could lead to a contract between you and the travel supplier. The following procedures are followed to finalize a Booking and confirm its validity: We request your offer to acquire Service Elements when we publish them on our website.</p>
            
            <p>This offer is not made until you click "Book" on the website's payment page, which is labelled "Review Trip Details and Book." Once you've done that, you've made ebooktrip.com an offer to buy the necessary Service Element(s) from the necessary Travel Supplier(s) that cannot be retracted if you change your mind (your "Booking"). In our sole discretion, we are free to accept or reject your offer on behalf of the pertinent Travel Supplier. The ebooktrip.com email confirmation only acknowledges that we have received your offer and NOT a formal acceptance of the Booking. The availability of the relevant Service Element(s) will need to be confirmed.</p>
           
            <p> Your reservation will be fulfilled if the necessary Service element is on hand. When payment in full is received, a contract is created about the specific Booking. Only those service elements confirmed by email with flight ticket numbers or reservation numbers for lodging, transportation, or activities will be covered under the contract between you and the applicable travel supplier. Before the formation of the contract between you and the Travel Supplier and the issuance of a ticket or confirmation of a reservation by the Travel Supplier, the terms of your Booking (such as price, availability, and/or travel dates) are not guaranteed. Please be aware that once you have finished the booking process, only by these Terms &amp; Conditions and at our discretion may you cancel or change the specifics of your Booking (such as names or destinations).</p>
           
            <p>These Booking procedures will apply to all the Terms &amp; Conditions for each of our Service Elements listed below. The terms and conditions for the airline tickets, hotels, auto rentals, and attractions and services supplement any area not covered by the Booking process. We have the right to modify the Booking procedure at any time, and modifications shall be effective as of the day they are posted on the site. During your trip, a government-issued photo ID will be required for security checks at airports, hotels, and car rental facilities. Additional documentation may also be required for attractions and other products, depending on the applicable Travel Suppliers' needs. For foreign travel (to the majority of nations outside of the United States), in addition to the government-issued identification that is required, as described above, proof of citizenship (a passport) is necessary. Please be aware that it is your complete duty to ensure that you meet the passport, visa, and/or health criteria of the nations you desire to visit and those through which you will be travelling (even if it is only for a quick flight change).</p>
          
            <p>Many nations demand that your passport be valid for at least a certain time after arrival. You should contact the relevant local consulate of the country you are visiting if you have doubts about the minimum duration that applies and any other criteria or passport/visa requirements for travel. If any of the conditions above are not met, you will not be entitled to any reimbursements from ebooktrip.com or its affiliates and will instead risk being denied boarding, detained, or deported. There can be government entry or exit fees depending on where you are going. These will be in addition to your booking fees and are solely your responsibility. If your Booking has more than one passenger, all passengers must follow the same itinerary. No specific passengers can be added to, removed, or changed from your booking. ebooktrip.com maintains the right to fix any pricing inaccuracies and, if necessary, give you a choice to either cancel the Booking or authorize ebooktrip.com to charge your specified credit or debit card with the new price before your departure. The specific Travel Supplier offers each Service Element indicated in your Booking. Frequent flyer miles and/or points could or might not be available for any portion of your Booking. This needs to be confirmed with the appropriate travel supplier.</p>
           
            <p>
                You are not permitted to move or modify the names or destinations stated in your booking once it has been made. Unless there are unusual circumstances, your booking will be completed on the delivery date provided in your ticket information email or, if no delivery date is specified, on the date the ticket is issued. The provisions of the contract of carriage for each airline are incorporated herein by reference. At the ticket offices in each airport or city, travelers can read the complete language of the contract of carriage. The complete text of the contract of carriage may be requested by passengers from the airlines and is subject to free distribution by mail or other means. The conditions that may be included in the transportation agreement are
            </p>


            <ol>
                <li>The airline's liability for passenger bodily injury or death and the loss, destruction, or delay of cargo and baggage, including fragile or perishable items, is restricted.</li>
                <li>Claim limitations, such as the time frames within which customers must claim or launch a lawsuit against an airline for any actions or inactions by its employees or agents.</li>
                <li>The airline's rights to modify the contract's conditions.</li>
                <li>Requirements for reservation reconfirmations, check-in timings, and carry-on denial. </li>
                <li>The airline's rights and obligations about service delays or failures, including rerouting, scheduling adjustments, and using substitute airlines or aircraft.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Pricing, Taxes/Fees, and Payment: Unless otherwise specified in your ticket information email or these Terms &amp; Conditions, our total prices include all relevant taxes and fees for transportation, lodging, rental cars, and activities included in your Booking. When you check-in, the appropriate Travel Supplier may charge you additional fees for fuel surcharges, security, baggage, seat reservations, hotel incidentals, and other applicable service fees. Any such additional fees owed to the travel supplier are entirely your responsibility. Please immediately contact the appropriate Travel Supplier with any inquiries concerning such fees. The prices listed for the Service Element(s) do not include any of the following: liability insurance, collision damage waiver, personal accident insurance, personal effects protection, drop-off fees, petrol, child safety seats, sky racks, or incidental room charges at the hotel (telephone, movies, energy surcharges and any applicable increases in taxes). All such fees are payable at the automobile rental pick-up location and hotel check-in desk. Prices listed also exclude any additional flight fuel surcharges or other fees that the relevant travel supplier or authorities may occasionally levy; all such charges are your responsibility to pay. When booking, payment in full using a legitimate credit or debit card is required. With a valid billing address, ebooktrip.com takes all major credit or debit cards. By providing us with your credit or debit card information, you authorize ebooktrip.com and its designated third party to charge the total cost of your Booking to that card. The applicable Travel Supplier(s) may request that you provide a valid credit or debit card at check-in at the hotel and/or at the location of pick-up for the rental car business to verify authorized card usage and/or to secure any additional charges.</p>
           
            <p>A traveler who is mentioned on your Booking must be the cardholder. Travel days, dates, minimum or maximum stays, holidays, seasons, blackout dates, stopovers, and/or waitlist restrictions are all possible; reservation validation limitations of up to one year (if any extension is permitted, penalties/restrictions may apply); other conditions/restrictions; and The "Warsaw Convention's rules may apply to the entirety of your trip, including any time spent fully inside the country of origin or destination, if your itinerary includes an ultimate destination or stopover in a nation other than the one from which you set out. The Warsaw Convention controls and may restrict certain air carriers' liability for passenger losses, personal injuries, and/or death. Until it is verified or ticketed, a reservation is not final. To safeguard our consumers, we check with the credit/debit Card Company to make sure that the billing address and credit card verification number you gave us are correct and that your debit or charge will be recognized. The fare may vary before such information is confirmed. If the debit/credit card billing address and/or credit card verification number cannot be promptly verified, we are not responsible for declining the transaction. We are also not responsible for any fare changes or other charges that may take place during our verification process. Your credit card may have received an approval code if the fare is unavailable. The authorization code may temporarily credit the amount from your bank account if the transaction is unsuccessful.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Changes to Flights Already Purchased</strong></p>

            <p>The majority of our tickets, hotels, automobiles, packages, and cruises do not permit date or name changes after the booking is complete; any changes made to the itinerary are prohibited as well as subject to airline fare rules, whichever is more restrictive. If the original itinerary has been amended by the supplier at the customer's request, ebooktrip.com does not guarantee and shall not be liable for any bookings or reservations made or confirmed to you. Customers who are elderly, in the military, physically disabled, have been afflicted by natural disasters, or are terminally ill may be eligible for a full or partial waiver of ebooktrip.com costs under the terms of our Compassion Exception Policy. Please carefully read our Compassion Exception Policy.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Cancel and Exchange</strong></p>

            <p>The majority of our flight travel is completely non-refundable. A credit may be usable towards a future ticket purchase by the same traveler on the airline when the carrier permits cancellations. The credit provided by the airline supplier typically has a deadline after which it can no longer be utilized. We advise you to talk with a customer service representative about any extra restrictions associated with your credit. Before the first flight segment's scheduled departure time, you must call our customer care center to cancel any such reservations where cancellations are allowed. No cancellation is guaranteed by us. If you want to use your airline credit when you're ready to make a new reservation, you'll need to pay the fare difference (if there is one), any applicable airline fines, and any post-ticketing fees levied by ebooktrip.com. Each airline's fare rules, policies, and processes, outside our control, govern all such adjustments. In addition to helping you choose your preferred new flights and making an effort to rebook the new flights depending on availability and other considerations, an agent will help you with our exchange fees. Customers who are senior citizens, members of the armed forces, physically challenged, have been affected by natural disasters, or are terminally ill may be eligible for a waiver of all or a portion of the ebooktrip.com costs under the terms of our Compassion Exception Policy. Please carefully read our policy on compassionate exceptions.</p>


            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Multiple Airline Itineraries</strong></p>

            <p>Please carefully read the terms and conditions of each airline, which may be found on each one's website, if your itinerary involves flights operated by more than one. Each airline will have its limitations, guidelines, and costs. The customer may be liable for any fees or ticket charges when changing the flight unaffected by an airline change (such as a flight cancellation or rescheduling). These airlines reserve the right to impose costs for exchange requests, refunds, or adjustments. The rules and conditions of each airline, which may vary (for instance, check-in times and baggage size/weight restrictions), are your responsibility. Before departing on any flight, you should print the outward and return portions of your e-ticket confirmation. At check-in, you might need to present documentation of your return ticket.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Cancel and Refund</strong></p>

            <p>After 12 hours of booking, most travel-related purchases-including airline tickets, lodging, pre-paid vehicle rentals, vacation packages, and service charges-are non-refundable. If travel has not started and you have cancelled by calling our customer care center, trip protection insurance is refundable within 10 days of purchase. Calls must be made by phone exclusively for any cancellations. Only if the following requirements are met will we accept refund requests: you have applied for a cancellation and refund with us, the fare rules must permit cancellations and refunds, and you are not a "no show" (most "no show" bookings are ineligible for any waiver from suppliers for refund processing), and we must be able to obtain waivers from suppliers to process this requested cancellation and refund. We cannot give a precise timeframe for how long it might take to process this requested refund. Refund requests are all handled in chronological order.</p>
           
            <p>We will email you to let you know that we have received your request to cancel after you have given our customer service representative your information. You do not necessarily qualify for a refund based on this notification. With this, you will receive a tracking number and an acknowledgment of your request. After receiving your request, we will work with the suppliers, including the airlines, hotels, and car rental agencies, to create a waiver by the rules of the airlines and other suppliers, and we will let you know the outcome. Getting a refund for the costs of the services we charged for making the initial travel booking or reservation is impossible. Please be aware that we rely on our suppliers for the requested refunds. It can take some time after the provider has accepted the refund before it appears on your credit card statement. All vendors will typically impose a fee for a refund. From the time your request is received until you see a credit on your bill, the full process could take 60 to 90 days. In addition to any refund penalties the airline and other providers impose, ebooktrip.com may impose a post-ticketing services fee. Every refund cost is calculated per ticket, per individual. Only when the airline/supplier rules allow for such returns and a refund has been authorized by the supplier or a waiver has been granted will these costs be applied. If the supplier does not process the requested refund, we will reimburse you for our post-ticketing service fees but not for the booking fees associated with the initial trip reservation or booking. Customers who are elderly, in the military, physically disabled, have been impacted by natural disasters, or are terminally ill may be granted a waiver on all or part of ebooktrip.com costs following our Compassion Exception Policy. Please carefully read our policy on compassionate exceptions airfare reduction.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Discount Airfares</strong></p>

            <p>Airline ticket discounts are now permitted because of the US Airline Deregulation Act, Open Sky Agreements, and ensuing codifications. We can offer you many published airfare prices at lower costs than the carriers listed because of our significant volume and diverse purchasing sources. Depending on the destination, referral source, season, and kind of fare, the discount's value may change.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Fare Changes And Post Payment Price Guarantee</strong></p>

            <p>If the flight cost or any other factor changes before the successful processing and acceptance of your form of payment, you may be notified of this change, and only after receiving such information do you have the option to accept or reject this transaction. You won't be charged if you choose to reject this transaction. Our Post-Purchase Price Guarantee We guarantee that we will honour the entire final quoted price of the airline tickets independent of any changes or fluctuations in the flight cost once we have successfully accepted and processed your payment (credit/debit card).
            </p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Payment Acceptance Policy</strong></p>

            <p>As noted in the billings section, we accept debit and credit cards from the US, Canada, and several other nations. Additionally, we accept billing addresses for AE/AP. Please be aware that the final total amount on your credit/debit card may be broken down into multiple charges. We will let you know within 24 hours (it can take longer for non-credit/debit card payment methods) if your credit/debit card or other form of payment is not processed or accepted for any reason. If there is a change in the cost of the airfare or any other change, you may be informed of this change before the processing and successful acceptance of your form of payment. Only after receiving this information do you have the option to accept or decline this transaction. You won't be charged if you choose to reject this transaction. Our Post-Purchase Price Guarantee We guarantee that we will honour the entire final quoted price of the airline tickets independent of any changes or fluctuations in the flight cost once we have successfully accepted and processed your payment (credit/debit card). We guarantee completely safe and secure credit card transactions. Please review our website's 100% Safe Purchase Guarantee before using a credit card. Please be aware that reservations for hotels, rentals of cars, and tours and activities are only finalized until full confirmation details have been sent to the email address you supplied when making the reservation. In some circumstances, confirmation might need to be paid for in advance. To further ensure your protection, when our systems identify certain transactions as high-risk, we will not process them until our credit card verification team has established that it is safe. We might contact you or your bank to confirm the legitimacy of such transactions.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Ticket Delivery</strong></p>

            <p>The majority of tickets are electronic (or "e-tickets"), although physical tickets are also made available on some itineraries when an e-ticket is not. Before confirming the booking, kindly check the delivery costs. If an e-ticket could not be produced for a specific reservation or if delivery of another good or service was in progress, ebooktrip.com will send the paper ticket, good, or service using a secure method of delivery (a reputable courier service), with the necessary shipping costs being deducted from the cardholder's account by the costs listed on the website. You can choose not to buy the tickets to avoid paying shipping fees because these shipping costs are displayed before you make the reservation. ebooktrip.com disclaims any liability for the delivery service's mistakes. We will try to redeliver, but we cannot guarantee it will happen on time. If you give the delivery service the wrong address, you might have to pay extra fees for the address change. The credit card that was used to make the purchase will be charged. If an e-ticket is created, the information about the ticket will be accessible on the website.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Credit/Debit Card Payment Terms</strong></p>

            <p>All credit cards must have confirmed billing addresses from the US, Canada, or another nation. Please refer to the drop-down menu under "Payment" on the checkout page for a list of nations that accept credit cards. Until tickets are issued, no reservations or prices are guaranteed. Bookings for hotels, rentals of automobiles, and vacation packages are not secure unless you obtain an email confirmation number.</p>
            
            <p>
                We request authorization for the sum of your projected transaction when you use a credit or debit card to make a purchase (putting a brief "hold" on the cash). You won't be charged if, for whatever reason, we cannot confirm your reservation, and we will ask your credit card company or debit Card Company to release the hold before we can use the funds for other purposes. Submitting a payment card does not ensure ticketing; we will let you know within 24 hours if your credit card is refused. 
            </p>
            
            <p> If your credit or debit card is not authorized or charged, ebooktrip.com is not liable. There may be a variety of causes for your credit or debit card not to have been approved or charged. Examples include the airline's inability to confirm the reservation, the fare increasing after the payment information was entered and before the purchase of the tickets, and the credit card's insufficient balance.</p>

            <p>You will be given alternate options and the chance to free cancel your reservation in cases where the fare may have increased. The reservation becomes non-refundable and non-cancellable once the price first given to you is applied to the tickets. To process credit card payments, ebooktrip.com employs strict security procedures. If there are any fraudulent transactions, they are reported to the airlines, federal and state law enforcement, and airport security. After the purchase is made and your tickets and/or other items are sent to you by email confirmation or shipped, you agree to be responsible for any credit card payments and refrain from disputing charges. When you have legitimately paid for a service on our website, but there is a chargeback or credit card dispute, you agree to pay ebooktrip.com back. Most telephone credit card transactions with our customer service department are recorded and available as proof in case of a dispute. When a user, or someone acting on their behalf, accepts these terms and conditions and continues with the purchase, using a credit card for an online transaction is authorized. Our technologies may flag certain transactions as high risk, but we won't proceed with them unless our credit card verification team says it's safe to do so to give you even more security. We may connect you or your bank to confirm the legitimacy of such transactions.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Credit Card Declines</strong></p>

            <p>When processing your order, we will try to email you within three business days to let you know if your credit card is declined. The transaction won't be carried out if your credit card is denied. The FARE and any other reservation information ARE NOT GUARANTEED. You can cancel your reservation for free if the fare changes. For this, there are no additional service fees.</p>

            <p>We retain the right to immediately cancel your access to this site if you repeatedly scan, collect, or scrape data from it or its screens.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Seats, Meals, Frequent Flyers  &amp; Other Requests</strong></p>

            <p>Please be aware that all special requests-for seats, meals, frequent flyer status, and other things-are requests only. The airline retains the right to change the proposed seat allocation without prior notice. Verification of all requests should be made with the airline. We can't promise you'll get the seat you want.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Baggage Policy on Connecting Flights</strong></p>

            <p>You might need to retrieve your bags at the connecting airport and check in again if two or more airlines operate the connecting aircraft. You are also cautioned that if you have excess baggage in these circumstances, you will be responsible for paying any excess baggage charges imposed by each airline. We advise lightly packing to save on these charges because most airlines now impose baggage fees for the first bag checked. Please visit our "Baggage Fees" page or search for a link to baggage costs on our website to find out where the fees on luggage check-in by airlines are located. Depending on the size, weight, and number of checked bags, baggage costs might range from 15 to 100 USD. These fees must be paid directly to the airline upon using this service. We try to maintain the baggage fees table up to date, but we advise you to speak with the airline directly for the most recent check baggage prices and policies.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Baggage Liability</strong></p>

            <p>Federal regulations demand that any cap on an airline's responsibility for lost or damaged baggage for domestic flights be at least $3,300 per passenger. Different liability limitations for baggage loss, delay, or damage exist while traveling internationally (including domestic segments of international itineraries). Unless a more significant value is disclosed in advance and additional fees are paid, the limit under the Montreal Convention is 1,131 Special Drawing Rights (or around $1700) per passenger. The Warsaw Convention limits unchecked baggage to $400 per traveler and checked luggage to about $9.07 per pound ($20 per kilogram) unless a more significant value is declared in advance and additional fees are paid. The excess valuation may not be stated on specific categories of valuable items. For fragile or perishable items, airlines disclaim all responsibility. The airline is the best source for additional details.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Baggage Policy and Fees</strong></p>

            <p>You will be responsible for any extra baggage charges each airline levies if you have too much luggage. We advise packing lightly to cut costs because most airlines now impose baggage fees even for the first bag checked in. Please visit our "Baggage Fees" page or search our website for a link to baggage fees to find the costs associated with checking in your luggage with the various airlines. Depending on the size and weight of the bags, a checked baggage fee of between $15 and $50 may apply. You must pay these fees directly to the airline upon using this service. Although we try to keep the baggage fees table current, we advise you to speak with the airline directly for the most up-to-date information on check luggage prices and baggage policies.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Overbooking of Flights</strong></p>

            <p>There is a slight chance that a seat won't be available on a flight for which a confirmed reservation has been made because airline aircraft can be overbooked. No one will be refused a seat if the flight is overbooked unless airline staff first solicits volunteers willing to cancel their ticket in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. The airline may refuse boarding to other passengers by its specific boarding priority if there are enough volunteers. With a few exceptions, such as failing to check in by the deadline specified by the airline (which is available upon request from the air carrier), people who are forcibly denied boarding are entitled to compensation from the airline. At all airport ticket desks and boarding areas, you may find the comprehensive compensation payment guidelines and the boarding priorities for each airline. While other consumer protections might be available, certain airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from certain foreign countries. For information, speak to the airline or give us a call.</p>

            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Airlines Schedule Changes/Flight Cancellations</strong></p>

            <p>Regarding scheduling modifications, every airline has different guidelines and standards. What are schedule modifications or cancellations, and why do they occur? Each airline frequently modifies its current operating flights according to operational requirements. These modifications can represent same-day changes as well as predictions of travel requirements for a future date. Possible alterations include flight number changes, schedule changes, route modifications, date changes, and cancellations. How do cancellations work? When an airline temporarily or permanently suspends service to certain cities or specific days of the week. Seasons with high or low traffic, changes to airport terminals or gates, fuel prices, civil unrest, and acts of God, such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, etc., are some of the causes of cancellations or schedule adjustments. Bankruptcy Due to any scheduled changes made by the airlines, ebooktrip.com disclaims all responsibility for cancelled flights, missed connections, or other flight-related mishaps. </p>

            <p>Schedule alterations are subject to the following procedure: We let the customer know whenever the timetable changes. Within 72 hours of departure, contacting the airline to confirm your trip is essential.</p>
