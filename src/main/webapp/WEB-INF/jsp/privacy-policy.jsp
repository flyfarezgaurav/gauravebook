            <p class="subheadings"><strong>Security</strong></p>

            <p>We place a high priority on the protection of your personally identifiable information.

Click this link to learn more about SSL. The high-grade encryption key (AES with 128 and 256-bit secret keys) is used on all our secure servers. Pages will take longer to download in the safe mode, even when SSL encryption is offered. Most customers sign up or use the usual wayspongea spoons. When switching from secure way to non-SSL pages, if your browser issues a warning, it's most likely because you are changing servers.</p>
